project is functional, stabile and has been tested. No immediate plans to change and no outstanding bugs.
see https://github.com/AdrianMolecule/inoculatingRobot/tree/main/documentation readme for most instructions.


This contains two different parts, the main robot software and an utility to convert image files into files with dot coordinates that can be loaded by the robot file and "painted" on a Petri dish.
The image convertor is at:
https://github.com/AdrianMolecule/inoculatingRobotSoftware/blob/main/image/dist/ImageConverter.exe
You can use that to load an image file and convert it to an .npy file that contains coordinates of points.
